  - This tastes like boiled grass... I want a refund!
  - Absolutely terrible. I regret this purchase.
  - How do you even sell this? It's undrinkable.
  - This is the worst tea I've ever had in my life.
  - I'm never coming back to this shop again.
  - You call this tea? Tastes like dishwater.
  - This ruined my entire day. Just awful.
  - I should have trusted my instincts and left.
  - What a complete waste of money.
