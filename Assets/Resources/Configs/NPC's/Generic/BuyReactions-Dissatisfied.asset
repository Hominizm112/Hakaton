  - Hmm, it's not quite what I was hoping for.
  - A bit disappointing for the price, honestly.
  - I've had better tea from the supermarket.
  - It's drinkable, but I expected more.
  - The aroma promised more than the taste delivered.
  - Not terrible, but certainly not great either.
  - I'll finish it, but I won't be buying it again.
  - A rather mediocre blend, to be honest.
  - The quality doesn't match the price point.
  - It's... acceptable. Barely.
