  - It's decent tea. Does the job.
  - Pretty standard blend, nothing special.
  - It's tea. Can't complain, can't praise.
  - Adequate for my daily cup.
  - Does what it says on the tin, I suppose.
  - It's fine. Not memorable, but fine.
  - Average tea for an average day.
  - It'll do until I find something better.
  - No complaints, but no compliments either.
  - Exactly what I expected - nothing more, nothing less.
